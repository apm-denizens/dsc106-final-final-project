the hook is going to be the anime girl that just pops up. 
the dataset as well cannot be dissapointing. 

provide motivation and intuition on how dimensionality reduction would be useful. 

scrolly teller probably
animation to fade things in. 
showing the idealized directions of the scroll. 

another option:
you want to perform an analysis on the images


figure out which images belong to which artist

1) 

hutao teaches you about principal component analysis

lets say that we have a dataset of images which we want to analyze
we could go through each image individually to figure out what makes them different
if there are only a couple images, it may not be that hard to do this (show a couple of the images)
however, if there are hundreds, or even thousands, (zoom out to draw all of the images), it can become quite time consuming and tedious. 

one way which you can quickly gain insight into your dataset is through reducing its dimensionality and make it visualizable. 
that way you can take a glance at the final visualization and get a feel for high-level patterns. 

if you're reducing the dimensionality of your dataset, it's inevitable that there's going to be information loss. 
if the term "information loss" is unfamiliar, here's an example that might help. 
lets say that my good friend luigi has been arrested for tax evaision and they're currently being interrogated. behind them is a picture of a clock. 
staring at that image of a clock, can you figure out what time it is? 
It's clear that its' 10 o clock. But is it 10:00 AM or 10:00 PM?
Because this image can "map" to multiple moments in time, it's impossible to know for sure.
In a sense, you can think of the image as being a "lossy" projection of reality.
"Information loss" has occured. 

To get a better sense of "information loss" and how it relates to dimensionality reduction, here's an interactive example. 



could do some interesting visualizations here: 
represent an image as a 4096 dimensional vector
stack these vectors into an array
