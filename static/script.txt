Luigi-nervous: W-Where am I?

HuTao-ghost: Hello Luigi, I am HuTao, the 77th Director of the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor. I have been sent by the Adventurers' Guild to teach you about principal component analysis. 

Luigi-scared: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Luigi-scared: PLEASE SPARE ME. 

HuTao-unamused: ...

HuTao-unamused: I am not here to harm you. I am here to teach you. 

Luigi-scared: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

HuTao-unamused: Anyhow... let's get started...

HuTao-ghost: Lets say that we have some images of faces which we want to analyze. 
HuTao-ghost: We could start off by going through each and every image to figure out similarities, differences, or patterns. 
HuTao-ghost: If there are only a few images, it should be pretty straightforward.
HuTao-ghost: Hover over the images to get a closer look. From the few images you see here, there should be no problem in quickly seeing that there are clear artistic styles. 
HuTao-ghost: But...
HuTao-ghost: But... what if we have hundreds...
HuTao-ghost: But... what if we have hundreds... thousands...
HuTao-spook: But... what if we have hundreds... thousands... or even TENS OF THOUSANDS of images?

Luigi-scared: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

HuTao-ghost: Yes, yes, truly a nightmare. I'll give you a moment to immerse yourself in such horror.
HuTao-ghost:

HuTao-ghost: One way which can help you quickly gain insight into a dataset is through reducing its dimensionality and making it visualizable.
